# Vehicles Price EDA Predict
# Overview:
This repository contains a project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling for vehicle prices. 
The goal is to analyze various factors affecting vehicle prices and build a model to predict prices based on these factors.

# Repository Structure:
 EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
 app.py: Python script for dashboard and prediction model using streamlit lib.
 car_price_prediction_model.zip: Compressed file containing the trained model.
 car_price_pridect.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for predicting car prices.
 car_prices.csv: Dataset containing raw car price data.
 cleaned_car_prices.csv: Dataset containing cleaned car price data.
 requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
